## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.

We welcome feedback and comments from Microsoft SMEs & learning partners who deliver MCWs.  

***Having trouble?***

- First, verify you have followed all written lab instructions (including the Before the Hands-on lab document).
- Next, submit an issue with a detailed description of the problem.
- Do not submit pull requests. Our content authors will make all changes and submit pull requests for approval.  

If you are planning to present a workshop, *review and test the materials early*! We recommend at least two weeks prior.

### Please allow 5 - 10 business days for review and resolution of issues
