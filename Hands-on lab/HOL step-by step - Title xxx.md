## Solution architecture

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the solution you implement in this hands-on lab. Please review this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a high-level overview of the architecture implemented within this hands-on lab.](media/architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

> **Note:** The solution provided is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

Hospitals in the Contoso Healthcare network provide PDF files of claim forms and WAV files of visit audio recordings via blobs in an Azure Storage account. Two event grid subscriptions propagate the blob creation events that trigger two separate functions in a [Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal).

One of the functions handles PDF processing. The function uses an [Azure Forms Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/form-recognizer/) that has a custom trainer model to extract the required information from forms. Once the metadata is extracted, the function saves the result in [Azure CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), allowing Contoso to build custom PowerBI reports with a direct query connection. Additionally, the data is indexed in an [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/) to be served in a unified search experience on the internal hospital portal.

A second function in the Function App processes audio recordings. Contoso uses [Azure Cognitive Speech Audio Language Identification](cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-automatic-language-detection?pivots=programming-language-csharp) to detect the language of the audio file and transcribe it to text. Once the text transcriptions are ready, Spanish transcriptions are translated to English using [Azure Cognitive Services Text Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator/). Finally, [Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics for Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner) is used to extract and label relevant medical information to provide a richer search experience in the internal hospital portal. Once the results are ready, the function saves the data in an Azure CosmosDB collection to be indexed by Azure Cognitive Search.

Finally, the internal hospital portal queries the indexes created in Azure Cognitive Search, offering a unified search experience for both structured and unstructured data sets.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.
