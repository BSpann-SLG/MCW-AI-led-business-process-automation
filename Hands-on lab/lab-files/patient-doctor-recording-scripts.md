**Patient:** Hello Doctor, I have had a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during the night. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days, and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP, so I do not know what to do? Please help.
**Doctor:** Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions. Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?
**Patient:** I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.
**Doctor:** I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen, or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.

**Patient:** Hello Doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time, the fever did not persist, and I also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup, and Betaline gargle solution. Since then, throat infection improved, and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably, though not completely. From yesterday onwards, fever is occurring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?  
**Doctor:** I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal, then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.  
**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor.

**Patient:** Hi, I am Chaitanya, 27 years old. I use to swim daily in the morning. Does COVID-19 spread through water? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?  
**Doctor:** Here is my advice. The first few cases were suspected of having spread from food. However, human to human spread is mainly from air droplets. Therefore, I would suggest you refrain from swimming for some time. Although the virus will get killed in the swimming pool if it does not find a host for more than a few minutes. Other precautions include avoiding social gatherings, wash hands frequently with soap and water, cover the face with a mask, stay home during sickness, avoid travel. I hope it helps. Let me know if I can assist you further.  
**Patient**: Thanks Doctor.

**Patient:** What is the treatment for Covid-19?
**Doctor:** Depends on severity. COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the Doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability.  
**Patient:** Thanks Doctor.

**Patient:** My 11-year-old has a cough, runny nose, headache, earache, no fever. Is this COVID-19?  
**Doctor:** The symptom pattern is not specific to one agent. It suggests a cold and ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19. Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. Parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or RSV would be more likely.
**Patient**: Thanks Doctor.

**Patient:** I traveled to Austria on 25 Jan 2020 and returned on 31Jan 2020. My trip included a stopover in Munich. I currently do not show any symptoms listed for coronavirus. Should I get lab-tested as a precaution, and will this test be covered by the medical?  
**Doctor:** In brief: Hard to say. The questions you pose are more appropriate to ask your local physicians and health plans. As a USA-based site, we have no access to or information about the changing local recommendations for world travel around the globe, nor would we know what your plan covers. Find a local health contact & contact your health plan for guidance.  
**Patient**: Appreciated Doctor.
