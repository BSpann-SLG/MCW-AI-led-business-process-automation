# \[insert workshop name here\] before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you set up an environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.

> **IMPORTANT**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure resources are uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you create an Azure resource group to serve as a container for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Add**.

   ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription (1)**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group (2)**: Enter **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** as the name of the new resource group.
   - **Region (3)**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create (4)**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Run ARM template to provision lab resources

1. To run the ARM template deployment, select the **Deploy to Azure** button below, which opens a custom deployment screen in the Azure portal.

   <a href ="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsolliancenet%2FSolliance_AI_Led_business_process_automation%2Fmain%2FHands-on%2520lab%2Flab-files%2FARM-template%2Fazure-deploy.json" target="_blank" title="Deploy to Azure">
      <img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton"/>
   </a>

2. On the custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, enter the following:

   - **Subscription (1)**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group (2)**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.
   - **Admin Password (3)**: Type in your custom password you will be using for the rest of the lab. The default password is `Password.1!!`

    ![The Custom deployment blade displays and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

3. Select **Review + create** and select **Create** on the next step to start provisioning the lab resources.

   > **Note**: The deployment of the custom ARM template takes about 10 minutes to complete. If the error indicates an issue with quotas in the region you selected for the resource group, you can delete the resource group, create a new resource group in a different region, and re-run the ARM template, or you can request a quota increase and then manually provision the missing resources.

4. You can monitor the progress of the deployment by navigating to the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group in the Azure portal and then selecting **Deployments (1)** from the left-hand menu. The deployment should be named **Microsoft.Template (2)**. Select the deployment item to view the progress of each individual component in the template.

   ![The Deployments menu item is selected in the left-hand menu of the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group and the Microsoft.Template deployment is highlighted.](media/resource-group-deployments.png "Resource group deployments")

### Task 3: Download lab artifacts

1. In the Azure Portal, open the Azure Cloud Shell by selecting its icon from the right side of the top toolbar. Be sure to select **Powershell** as the shell type.

    ![A portion of the Azure Portal taskbar is displayed with the Cloud Shell icon highlighted.](media/bhol_azurecloudshellmenu.png "Opening the Cloud Shell")

    > **Note**: If you are prompted to create a storage account for the Cloud Shell, agree to have it created.

2. In the Cloud Shell window, enter the following command to clone the repository files.

    ```PowerShell
    git clone https://github.com/solliancenet/Solliance_AI_Led_business_process_automation.git MCW
    ```

3. Keep the Cloud Shell open.

### Task 4: Establish a user context

1. In the Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

    ```cli
    az login
    ```

2. A message will be displayed asking you to open a new tab in your web browser, navigate to [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) and to enter a code for authentication.

   ![A message is displayed indicating to enter an authentication code on the device login page.](media/bhol_devicelogin.png "Authentication message")

   ![A dialog is shown requesting the entry of a code.](media/bhol_clicodescreen.png "Authentication dialog")

3. Once complete, you may close the tab from the previous step and return to the Cloud Shell.

### Task 5: Run environment setup PowerShell script

When executing the script below, it is important to let the scripts run to completion. Some tasks may take longer than others to run. When a script completes execution, you will be returned to a command prompt.

1. In the Cloud Shell, change the current directory to the **automation** folder of the cloned repository by executing the following:

    ```PowerShell
    cd "./MCW/Hands-on lab/lab-files/ARM-template"
    ```

2. Execute the **post-provisioning.ps1** script by executing the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    ./post-provisioning.ps1
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter the name of your desired Azure Subscription. You can copy and paste the value from the list to select one. You will also be prompted for the following information for this script:

    | Prompt |
    |--------|
    | Enter the desired Azure Subscription for this lab (you will be able to copy and paste from a listing) |
    | Enter the name of your resource group. |

3. At the end of the script, you should see a message indicating **Environment setup complete**.
