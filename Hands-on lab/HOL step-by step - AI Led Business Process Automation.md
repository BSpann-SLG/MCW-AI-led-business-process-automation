## Overview

\[insert your custom workshop content here . . . \]

## Solution architecture

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the solution you implement in this hands-on lab. Please review this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a high-level overview of the architecture implemented within this hands-on lab.](media/architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

> **Note:** The solution provided is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

Hospitals in the Contoso Healthcare network provide PDF files of claim forms and WAV files of visit audio recordings via blobs in an Azure Storage account. Two event grid subscriptions propagate the blob creation events that trigger two separate functions in a [Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal).

One of the functions handles PDF processing. The function uses an [Azure Forms Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/form-recognizer/) that has a custom trainer model to extract the required information from forms. Once the metadata is extracted, the function saves the result in [Azure CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), allowing Contoso to build custom PowerBI reports with a direct query connection. Additionally, the data is indexed in an [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/) to be served in a unified search experience on the internal hospital portal.

A second function in the Function App processes audio recordings. Contoso uses [Azure Cognitive Speech Audio Language Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-automatic-language-detection?pivots=programming-language-csharp) to detect the language of the audio file and transcribe it to text. Once the text transcriptions are ready, Spanish transcriptions are translated to English using [Azure Cognitive Services Text Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator/). Finally, [Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics for Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner) is used to extract and label relevant medical information to provide a richer search experience in the internal hospital portal. Once the results are ready, the function saves the data in an Azure CosmosDB collection to be indexed by Azure Cognitive Search.

Finally, the internal hospital portal queries the indexes created in Azure Cognitive Search, offering a unified search experience for both structured and unstructured data sets.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Extract text and structure from documents with Forms Recognizer

Duration: 45 minutes

Azure Form Recognizer is a part of [Azure Applied AI Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/) that lets you build automated data processing software using machine learning technology. You can identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, tables, and structure from your documents. The service outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file, bounding boxes, confidence, and more. You can quickly get accurate results tailored to your specific content without heavy manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Form Recognizer comprises custom document processing models, prebuilt models for invoices, receipts, IDs and business cards, and the layout model.

Contoso has its own document template for claims processing. In this exercise, you will be using a set of documents to train a custom model with labels. When you train with labeled data, the model uses supervised learning to extract values of interest, using the labeled forms you provide. In this case, Form Recognizer uses the [Layout API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/concept-layout) to learn the expected sizes and positions of printed and handwritten text elements and extract values.

### Task 1: Prepare custom model to process documents

1. To access the training data in Azure Storage, we need a [SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/delegate-access-with-shared-access-signature) access link. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account Overview page by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account from the list of resources.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The storage account is highlighted.](media/select-storage-account.png "Storage Account Selection")

2. Once you are on the Storage Account Overview page, switch to the **Containers (1)** panel.  Select **claimstraining (2)** container and open the context menu with the three dots **(3)** at the end of the row. Select **Generate SAS (4)**.

### Task 2: Configuring Azure Functions and Event Grid for document uploads

As part of its automation process, Contoso will upload claims documents in the form of PDF files to an Azure Storage account as blobs. An Azure Function App has to detect new files and process them with the trained Forms Recognizer Model. [Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview) is the perfect candidate to build applications with event-based architectures thanks to its built-in support for events coming from Azure services, like storage blobs and resource groups. For the Functions App to detect new blobs, you will be using an Azure Event Grid subscription and defining an event handler for the matching Azure Function.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account Overview page by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account from the list of resources.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The storage account is highlighted.](media/select-storage-account.png "Storage Account Selection")

    You can go back to CosmosDB Claims collection and observe the new results.

## Exercise 2: Extract Health Analytics from visit audio records

Duration: 45 minutes

Contoso uploads audio recordings of patient visits to an Azure Storage Blob service. An Azure Function will be triggered with an Event Grid subscription/event handler to process recordings. The function will first detect the language of the recording using [Azure Cognitive Speech Audio Language Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-automatic-language-detection?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and then transcribe it to text. Once transcriptions are ready, Spanish records will be translated to English based on Contoso's requirements. Finally, [Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics for Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-for-health?tabs=ner) will extract and label relevant medical information to provide a richer search experience. During the exercise, you will integrate all the pieces, run a couple of sample recordings, and observe the results.

### Task 1: Configuring Azure Functions and Event Grid for audio uploads

As part of its automation process, Contoso will upload audio recordings of patient visits as WAV files to an Azure Storage account as blobs. An Azure Function App has to detect new files and process them with multiple Cognitive Services. For the Functions App to detect new blobs, you will be using a new Azure Event Grid subscription and defining an event handler for the matching Azure Function.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account Overview page by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account from the list of resources.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The storage account is highlighted.](media/select-storage-account.png "Storage Account Selection")

   ![ClaimsProcessing function is selected. Add Event Grid Subscription link is highlighted.](media/event-grid-add-subscription-for-audioprocessing.png "Add Event Grid Subscription")

5. Set the values listed below.

    - **Name (1):** **AudioEvents**
    - **Topic Type (2):** Storage account.
    - **Source Resource (3):** Contoso storage account.
    - **System Topic Name (4):** **DocumentEvent**
    - **Filter to Event Types (5):** Blob Created

   ![Create event subscription page is presented. The event name is set to DocumentEvents. Topic Type is set to Storage account. Source Resource is set to contosoSUFFIX storage account. System Topic Name is set to DocumentEvent. Blob Created and Blob Deleted events are selected. Create button is highlighted.](media/event-grid-create-subscription-for-audio.png "Event Grid Subscription Settings")

    Select **Create (6)** to continue.

### Task 2: Connecting Cognitive Services to Azure Functions

For audio recording processing, the AudioProcessing function will use multiple Cognitive Service accounts. Cognitive Services Speech will be used to detect the language of the recording and to transcribe the audio file. Cognitive Services Translator will be used to translate Spanish transcriptions to English. Finally, Cognitive Services Text Analytics will be used to extract and label relevant medical information from transcriptions. In this task, you will be connecting all the required Cognitive Services to the AudioProcessing Azure Function.

## Exercise 3: Using Azure Cognitive Search to index and serve data

Duration: X minutes

Contoso has an internal web portal hosted in an Azure App Service where staff can access various content and forms. The organization is looking to enhance the portal by centralizing patient information, streamlining, unifying, and simplifying access to claims documents and audio recordings. In this exercise, you will be indexing claims and audio transcriptions data sets in a Cognitive Search service using indexers that connect to Cosmos DB. [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) is a cloud search service that gives developers an architecture, APIs, and tools to build rich search experiences over private, heterogenous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. Finally, you will configure the web portal to use the indexes for a unified search experience enriched with health analytics metadata.

### Task 1: Setting up indexer for forms documents

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contoso-search-SUFFIX** Search service's Overview page by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **contoso-search-SUFFIX** Search service from the list of resources.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The search service is highlighted.](media/select-search-service.png "Search Service Selection")

2. Once you are on the **Overview (1)** page select **Import data (2)** to continue.

   ![Azure Cognitive Search Overview page is open. Import data is highlighted.](media/search-import-data.png "Import Data for Search")
